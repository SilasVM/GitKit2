This activity introduces the concepts of FOSS. It then investigates some
elements, structures, roles and principles shared by many (but not all)
FOSS.

**Content Learning Objectives**
-------------------------------

*After completing this activity, students should be able to:*

-  Describes the general concepts and the main terms of FOSS.

-  Describe reasons that individuals support & participate in FOSS
   projects, including but not limited to financial incentives.

-  Describe roles in a typical FOSS project, and how people transition
   between roles.

**Process Skill Goals**
-----------------------

*During the activity, students should make progress toward:*

-  Teamwork

-  Information processing

**Team Roles**
--------------

-  *Before you start, make sure everyone in your team has a new role
   (not the same role as the last activity).*

-  *If you have three people, combine the Manager and Reflector roles.*

*Record role assignments here.*

**Model 1: FOSS Introduction**
==============================

**Information**
---------------

An open source software community is a group of people united by the
shared purpose of developing, maintaining, extending, and promoting a
specific body of open source software. These communities are often
globally distributed—their members occupy different geographic regions
and work across numerous industries. What unites them is their common
vision for the open source software project—as well as the spirit of
camaraderie and collective identity that participating in the community
affords them.

**For this model, instructors can choose to:**

-  **Post the video as homework before class starts**

-  **Play the video in the classroom before students start working on
   the model.**

-  **The video duration is 5:41 sec.**

**Instructions and Questions (15 min)**
---------------------------------------

1. Watch the “Open Source Basics” video by Sarah Moyle for Intel
   Software. The video uses “family cookies recipe” as a metaphor for
   the processes that FOSS communities use to collaborate.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tyd0FO0tko8

**As a team, discuss these terms from the video and agree on a brief
description for each of them (your descriptions can be changed or
enhanced in the next POGIL activities):**

a. **Roles:**

b. **Rules -> License:**

c. **Contributor:**

d. **Maintainer:**

e. **Upstreaming:**

f. **Branch / Patch:**

g. **Main branch:**

h. **Fork:**

1. **What does “Upstream early and often” mean? and why we need to do
   it?**

2. **Who makes up the community in the Cookie example?**

3. **What are some challenges that an open source community will face?**

-  **Coordination and Collaboration**

-  **globally distributed**

-  **different regions / languages / time zones**

-  **different industries**

4. **What advantages/opportunities does an open source community
   afford?**

-  **larger community**

-  **more diverse community**

-  **varied perspectives**

-  **distinct skill sets and expertise
   **

**Motivations**

In 2001, Karim Lakhani and Robert Wolf surveyed 684 developers in 287
FOSS projects to understand why they contributed to FOSS. The table
below summarizes their survey results.

**Model 3: FOSS Principles**
============================

.. _information-2:

**Information**
---------------

**Principles of FOSS Communities:**

-  Transparency.

-  Collaboration.

-  Release early and often.

-  Inclusive meritocracy.

-  Community.

Read more about the principles in:
https://opensource.com/open-source-way

.. _instructions-and-questions-10-min-1:

**Instructions and Questions (10 min)**
---------------------------------------

1. Discuss the meaning of these words (Principles) and what do you think
      they mean in the context of a FOSS community?

2. Why are these principles good things?

3. Consider each of the following statements about the operation of a
      FOSS community and label it with the principle (or principles if
      multiple apply) with which it most closely aligns.

+-----------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| **Statement**                     | **FOSS Community Principle(s)** |
+===================================+=================================+
| By building on each other’s work  |                                 |
| the community can solve problems  |                                 |
| that no one could solve alone.    |                                 |
+-----------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Decisions and the rationale for   |                                 |
| them are available to the         |                                 |
| community.                        |                                 |
+-----------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| The mission and goals of the      |                                 |
| community are more important than |                                 |
| individual agendas.               |                                 |
+-----------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| The best ideas should win,        |                                 |
| regardless of where they come     |                                 |
| from.                             |                                 |
+-----------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Incorporating new changes and     |                                 |
| features quickly generates        |                                 |
| feedback and leads to rapid       |                                 |
| improvement.                      |                                 |
+-----------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Community members enhance and     |                                 |
| extend what others contribute in  |                                 |
| unanticipated ways.               |                                 |
+-----------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Decision makers continually seek  |                                 |
| diverse perspectives.             |                                 |
+-----------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| All community members have access |                                 |
| to the information necessary to   |                                 |
| do their best work.               |                                 |

**Model 4: FOSS Community Structures**
======================================

.. _information-3:

**Information**
---------------

Below, two examples of pyramidal-structured organizations (*non-FOSS*).

|image0|

.. _instructions-and-questions-15-min-1:

**Instructions and Questions (15 min)**
---------------------------------------

1. As shown above, in many organizations, people are in a **pyramidal
      structure**.

+--------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
| **a.** | What is the largest group   | .. rubric:: **Students**    |
|        | of people in a college and  |    :name: students          |
|        | in a business?              |                             |
+--------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
| **b.** | What is the level above     | .. rubric:: **Team          |
|        | workers in a business?      |    Leaders**                |
|        |                             |    :name: team-leaders      |
+--------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+

2. As we move down the pyramid (from top to bottom):

+--------+------------------------------------------------+----------------------+
| **a.** | Do responsibility and authority go up or down? | .. rubric:: **down** |
|        |                                                |    :name: down       |
+--------+------------------------------------------------+----------------------+
| **b.** | Does the number of people go up or down?       | .. rubric:: **up**   |
|        |                                                |    :name: up         |
+--------+------------------------------------------------+----------------------+

3. Most large FOSS projects also have a pyramidal structure, but with
      different roles.

a. **Contributors** who add patches and test cases.

b. **Core team** of developers who work on the code, test suites, and
   documentation.

c. **Leaders** who make key decisions and consider long-term project
   goals.

d. **Requesters** who report defects and ask for new features.

e. **Users** who download and use the software.

Put these roles (a-e) above in the correct order in the pyramid below:

+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+---+---+---+---+
|          |          |          |          | .. rubri |   |   |   |   |

4. In a typical FOSS project:

+--------+-----------------------------+---------------------------+
| **a.** | Which role has the largest  | .. rubric:: **User**      |
|        | number of people?           |    :name: user            |
+--------+-----------------------------+---------------------------+
| **b.** | Which role has the smallest | .. rubric:: **Leader**    |
|        | number of people?           |    :name: leader          |
+--------+-----------------------------+---------------------------+
| **c.** | What is the most likely     | .. rubric:: **Leader**    |
|        | role for the people who     |    :name: leader-1        |
|        | started the project?        |                           |
+--------+-----------------------------+---------------------------+
| **d.** | Which role could a typical  | .. rubric:: **Requester** |
|        | user easily transition to   |    :name: requester       |
|        | if they wanted to           |                           |
|        | contribute more to the      |                           |
|        | project?                    |                           |
+--------+-----------------------------+---------------------------+
| **e.** | Which role is most likely   | .. rubric:: **Core**      |
|        | to provide new leaders for  |    :name: core            |
|        | the project?                |                           |
+--------+-----------------------------+---------------------------+
| **f.** | Which role is most likely   | .. rubric:: **Requester** |
|        | to provide new              |    :name: requester-1     |
|        | contributors?               |                           |
+--------+-----------------------------+---------------------------+

5. Consider each of the actions described below. For each action, label
   it with the role of the individual (or individuals if multiple apply)
   that is *most likely* to be responsible for the action.

============================================================== ========
**Action**                                                     **Role**
============================================================== ========
Choosing the license under which the project will be released. 
Using the software in a new, unanticipated or creative way.    
Asking that a useful new feature be added to the software.     
Discovering a bug in the software.                             
Providing a code patch that fixes a bug in the software.       
Submitting an improved set of installation instructions.       
Documenting a bug in the issue tracker so others can fix it.   
Defining the goals for the next year of work on the project.   
Incorporating a contributed bug fix into the main branch.

**Model 5: FOSS Anatomy**
-------------------------

.. _information-4:

**Information**
---------------

Open-source projects have a distinct culture and set of tools that
support project development. The form of the culture and the specific
tools vary somewhat across projects, but there is significant
commonality such that many open source developers migrate easily among
open source projects. This model focuses on Sugar Labs, a
well-established humanitarian open source (FOSS) project.

.. _section-4:

.. _instructions-and-questions-15-min-2:

**Instructions and Questions (15 min)**
---------------------------------------

1. Listed below are several important starting points for the *Sugar
      Labs* project. Take a quick look at each and then answer the
      questions below.

-  http://sugarlabs.org/

-  https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Welcome_to_the_Sugar_Labs_wiki

-  https://github.com/sugarlabs

-  https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-docs

Answer the following questions:

a) Which of the links above would be the best starting point for someone
      interested in using Sugar?

b) Which of the links above would be the best starting point for someone
      interested in contributing to Sugar?

   1. Check the `Getting
         Involved <https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Getting_Involved>`__
         page which describes the roles of various contributors to Sugar
         Labs. Note that there are a variety of different types of
         contributions that may be made by people in different roles.

Answer the following questions:

a) What roles do you think would be most applicable for a new
      participant?

b) What are the commonalities across roles? What are the differences?

**Team’s Reflection (5 min)**

-  *Reflector:* lead the discussion to review the team’s performance
   during the activity. The team must discuss two positive points and
   two areas for improvement for the next activities.

-  *Recorder:* type the discussion’s summary.

-  *Reflector:* be ready to present the points when asked.
