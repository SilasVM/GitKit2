This activity introduces the concepts of FOSS. It then investigates some
elements, structures, roles and principles shared by many (but not all)
FOSS.

**Content Learning Objectives**
-------------------------------

*After completing this activity, students should be able to:*

-   Describes the general concepts and the main terms of FOSS.

-   Describe reasons that individuals support & participate in FOSS
    projects, including but not limited to financial incentives.

-   Describe roles in a typical FOSS project, and how people transition
    between roles.

**Process Skill Goals**
-----------------------

*During the activity, students should make progress toward:*

-   Teamwork

-   Information processing

**Team Roles**
--------------

-   *Before you start, make sure everyone in your team has a new role
    (not the same role as the last activity).*

-   *If you have three people, combine the Manager and Reflector roles.*

*Record role assignments here.*

**Model 1: FOSS Introduction**
==============================

**Information**
---------------

An open source software community is a group of people united by the
shared purpose of developing, maintaining, extending, and promoting a
specific body of open source software. These communities are often
globally distributed---their members occupy different geographic regions
and work across numerous industries. What unites them is their common
vision for the open source software project---as well as the spirit of
camaraderie and collective identity that participating in the community
affords them.

***For this model, instructors can choose to:***

-   ***Post the video as homework before class starts***

-   ***Play the video in the classroom before students start working on
    the model.***

-   ***The video duration is 5:41 sec.***

**Instructions and Questions (15 min)**
---------------------------------------

1.  Watch the "Open Source Basics" video by Sarah Moyle for Intel
    Software. The video uses "family cookies recipe" as a metaphor for
    the processes that FOSS communities use to collaborate.

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tyd0FO0tko8>

**As a team, discuss these terms from the video and agree on a brief
description for each of them (your descriptions can be changed or
enhanced in the next POGIL activities):**

a.  **Roles:**

b.  **Rules -\> License:**

c.  **Contributor:**

d.  **Maintainer:**

e.  **Upstreaming:**

f.  **Branch / Patch:**

g.  **Main branch:**

h.  **Fork:**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  **What does "Upstream early and often" mean? and why we need to do
    it?**

2.  **Who makes up the community in the Cookie example?**

3.  **What are some challenges that an open source community will
    face?**

-   **Coordination and Collaboration**

-   **globally distributed**

-   **different regions / languages / time zones**

-   **different industries**

4.  **What advantages/opportunities does an open source community
    afford?**

-   **larger community**

-   **more diverse community**

-   **varied perspectives**

-   **distinct skill sets and expertise\

**Model 3: FOSS Principles**
============================

**Information**
---------------

**Principles of FOSS Communities:**

-   Transparency.

-   Collaboration.

-   Release early and often.

-   Inclusive meritocracy.

-   Community.

Read more about the principles in:
<https://opensource.com/open-source-way>

**Instructions and Questions (10 min)**
---------------------------------------

1.  Discuss the meaning of these words (Principles) and what do you
    > think they mean in the context of a FOSS community?

2.  Why are these principles good things?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
3.  Consider each of the following statements about the operation of a
    > FOSS community and label it with the principle (or principles if
    > multiple apply) with which it most closely aligns.

  **Statement**                                                                                       **FOSS Community Principle(s)**
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
  By building on each other's work the community can solve problems that no one could solve alone.    
  Decisions and the rationale for them are available to the community.                                
  The mission and goals of the community are more important than individual agendas.                  
  The best ideas should win, regardless of where they come from.                                      
  Incorporating new changes and features quickly generates feedback and leads to rapid improvement.   
  Community members enhance and extend what others contribute in unanticipated ways.                  
  Decision makers continually seek diverse perspectives.                                              
  All community members have access to the information necessary to do their best work.

**Model 4: FOSS Community Structures**
======================================

**Information**
---------------

Below, two examples of pyramidal-structured organizations (*non-FOSS*).

![](media/image1.png){width="6.5in" height="1.6055555555555556in"}

**Instructions and Questions (15 min)**
---------------------------------------

1.  As shown above, in many organizations, people are in a **pyramidal
    > structure**.

+--------+-----------------------------+-----------------------+
| **a.** | What is the largest group   | #### **S              |
|        | of people in a college and  | tudents** {#students} |
|        | in a business?              |                       |
+--------+-----------------------------+-----------------------+
| **b.** | What is the level above     | #### **Team Lead      |
|        | workers in a business?      | ers** {#team-leaders} |
+--------+-----------------------------+-----------------------+

2.  As we move down the pyramid (from top to bottom):

+--------+------------------------------------------------+---------------+
| **a.** | Do responsibility and authority go up or down? | #### **down** |
+--------+------------------------------------------------+---------------+
| **b.** | Does the number of people go up or down?       | #### **up**   |
+--------+------------------------------------------------+---------------+

3.  Most large FOSS projects also have a pyramidal structure, but with
    > different roles.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  **Contributors** who add patches and test cases.

b.  **Core team** of developers who work on the code, test suites, and
    documentation.

c.  **Leaders** who make key decisions and consider long-term project
    goals.

d.  **Requesters** who report defects and ask for new features.

e.  **Users** who download and use the software.

Put these roles (a-e) above in the correct order in the pyramid below:

+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+---+---+---+---+

  Providing a code patch that fixes a bug in the software.         
  Submitting an improved set of installation instructions.         
  Documenting a bug in the issue tracker so others can fix it.     
  Defining the goals for the next year of work on the project.     
  Incorporating a contributed bug fix into the main branch.        
  Redesigning a critical software module in the system.

**Model 5: FOSS Anatomy**
-------------------------

**Information**
---------------

Open-source projects have a distinct culture and set of tools that
support project development. The form of the culture and the specific
tools vary somewhat across projects, but there is significant
commonality such that many open source developers migrate easily among
open source projects. This model focuses on Sugar Labs, a
well-established humanitarian open source (FOSS) project.

**Instructions and Questions (15 min)**

1.  Listed below are several important starting points for the *Sugar
    > Labs* project. Take a quick look at each and then answer the
    > questions below.
