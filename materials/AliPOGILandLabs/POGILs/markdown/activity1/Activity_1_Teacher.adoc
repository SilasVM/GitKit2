== Activity 1: Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)

This activity introduces the concepts of FOSS. It then investigates some
elements, structures, roles and principles shared by many (but not all)
FOSS.

=== Content Learning Objectives

_After completing this activity, students should be able to:_

* Describes the general concepts and the main terms of FOSS.
* Describe reasons that individuals support & participate in FOSS
projects, including but not limited to financial incentives.
* Describe roles in a typical FOSS project, and how people transition
between roles.

=== Process Skill Goals

_During the activity, students should make progress toward:_

* Teamwork
* Information processing

=== Team Roles

* _Before you start, make sure everyone in your team has a new role (not
the same role as the last activity)._
* _If you have three people, combine the Manager and Reflector roles._

_Record role assignments here._

* Manager:
* Presenter:
* Recorder:

=== Model 1: FOSS Introduction

==== Information

An open source software community is a group of people united by the
shared purpose of developing, maintaining, extending, and promoting a
specific body of open source software. These communities are often
globally distributed—their members occupy different geographic regions
and work across numerous industries. What unites them is their common
vision for the open source software project—as well as the spirit of
camaraderie and collective identity that participating in the community
affords them.

____

=== Model 5: FOSS Anatomy

==== Information

Open-source projects have a distinct culture and set of tools that
support project development. The form of the culture and the specific
tools vary somewhat across projects, but there is significant
commonality such that many open source developers migrate easily among
open source projects. This model focuses on Sugar Labs, a
well-established humanitarian open source (FOSS) project.

==== Instructions and Questions (15 min)

[arabic]
. Listed below are several important starting points for the _Sugar
Labs_ project. Take a quick look at each and then answer the questions
below.
* http://sugarlabs.org/
* https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Welcome\_to\_the\_Sugar\_Labs\_wiki
* https://github.com/sugarlabs
* https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-docs
+
Answer the following questions:
[loweralpha]
.. Which of the links above would be the best starting point for someone
interested in using Sugar?
.. Which of the links above would be the best starting point for someone
interested in contributing to Sugar?
. Check the
https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Getting_Involved[Getting
Involved] page which describes the roles of various contributors to
Sugar Labs. Note that there are a variety of different types of
contributions that may be made by people in different roles.
+
Answer the following questions:
[loweralpha]
.. What roles do you think would be most applicable for a new
participant?
.. What are the commonalities across roles? What are the differences?

=== Team’s Reflection (5 min)

during the activity. The team must discuss two positive points and two
areas for improvement for the next activities.
* _Recorder:_ type the discussion’s summary.
* _Reflector:_ be ready to present the points when asked.
