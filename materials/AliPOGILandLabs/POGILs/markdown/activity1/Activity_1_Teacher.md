# Activity 1: Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)


This activity introduces the concepts of FOSS. It then investigates some
elements, structures, roles and principles shared by many (but not all)
FOSS.

## Content Learning Objectives

*After completing this activity, students should be able to:*

-   Describes the general concepts and the main terms of FOSS.

-   Describe reasons that individuals support & participate in FOSS
    projects, including but not limited to financial incentives.

-   Describe roles in a typical FOSS project, and how people transition
    between roles.

## Process Skill Goals

*During the activity, students should make progress toward:*

-   Teamwork

-   Information processing

## Team Roles

-   *Before you start, make sure everyone in your team has a new role
    (not the same role as the last activity).*

-   *If you have three people, combine the Manager and Reflector roles.*

*Record role assignments here.*

* Manager:
* Presenter:
* Recorder:
* Reflector:


## Model 1: FOSS Introduction

### Information

An open source software community is a group of people united by the
shared purpose of developing, maintaining, extending, and promoting a
specific body of open source software. These communities are often
globally distributed---their members occupy different geographic regions
and work across numerous industries. What unites them is their common
vision for the open source software project---as well as the spirit of
camaraderie and collective identity that participating in the community
affords them.

> **INSTRUCTOR**
>
> For this model, instructors can choose to:
>
> - Post the video as homework before class starts
>
> - Play the video in the classroom before students start  working on
>    the model.
>
> The video duration is 5:41 sec.


### Instructions and Questions (15 min)

1.  Watch the "Open Source Basics" video by Sarah Moyle for Intel
    Software. The video uses "family cookies recipe" as a metaphor for
    the processes that FOSS communities use to collaborate.

    <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tyd0FO0tko8>

    As a team, discuss these terms from the video and agree on a brief
    description for each of them (your descriptions can be changed or
    enhanced in the next POGIL activities):

    a.  Roles:

    b.  Rules -\> License:

    c.  Contributor:

    d.  Maintainer:

    e.  Upstreaming:

    f.  Branch / Patch:

    g.  Main branch:

    h.  Fork:

2.  What does "Upstream early and often" mean? and why we need to do it?

3.  Who makes up the community in the Cookie example?

4.  What are some challenges that an open source community will
    face?

    > **POTENTIAL ANSWERS**
    > - Coordination and Collaboration
    > - globally distributed
    > - different regions / languages / time zones
    > - different industries

5.  What advantages/opportunities does an open source community
    afford?

    > **POTENTIAL ANSWERS**
    > -   **larger community**
    > -   **more diverse community**
    > -   **varied perspectives**
    > -   **distinct skill sets and expertise**

## Model 5: FOSS Anatomy

### Information

Open-source projects have a distinct culture and set of tools that
support project development. The form of the culture and the specific
tools vary somewhat across projects, but there is significant
commonality such that many open source developers migrate easily among
open source projects. This model focuses on Sugar Labs, a
well-established humanitarian open source (FOSS) project.

### Instructions and Questions (15 min)

1.  Listed below are several important starting points for the *Sugar Labs* project. Take a quick look at each and then answer the questions below.

    -   <http://sugarlabs.org/>
    -   <https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Welcome\_to\_the\_Sugar\_Labs\_wiki>
    -   <https://github.com/sugarlabs>
    -   <https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-docs>

    Answer the following questions:

    a.  Which of the links above would be the best starting point for someone interested in using Sugar?

    b.  Which of the links above would be the best starting point for someone interested in contributing to Sugar?

2.  Check the [Getting Involved](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Getting_Involved) page which describes the roles of various contributors to Sugar Labs. Note that there are a variety of different types of contributions that may be made by people in different roles.

    Answer the following questions:

    a.  What roles do you think would be most applicable for a new participant?

    b.  What are the commonalities across roles? What are the differences?


## Team's Reflection (5 min)

-   *Reflector:* lead the discussion to review the team's performance
    during the activity. The team must discuss two positive points and
    two areas for improvement for the next activities.

-   *Recorder:* type the discussion's summary.

-   *Reflector:* be ready to present the points when asked.
